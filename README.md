## Learning Approaches

### AuDHD-Optimized Sequence
Designed specifically for neurodivergent learners, this approach features:
- **Pattern-based Learning**: Characters are introduced in a sequence that emphasizes pattern relationships
- **Strategic Review Cycles**: After learning several characters, dedicated review lessons reinforce knowledge
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Clear visual and auditory distinctions between consecutive characters
- **Consistent Structure**: Predictable lesson format with incremental difficulty increases
- **Progression**: E, T, A, N, (Review), I, M, S, O, (Review), R, K, D, etc.

### Koch Method
The Koch method introduces characters at full speed one at a time, training your brain to recognize sounds rather than counting dots and dashes. Characters are introduced in an order that maximizes the distinction between sounds, starting with K, M, U, R, etc.

### Logical Method
The Logical method starts with the simplest characters (T, E) and progressively introduces more complex ones. Characters are grouped in logical pairs (T&E, A&N, I&M, etc.), making it easier for beginners to follow a structured progression.

All methods use Farnsworth timing, which extends the spaces between characters, making it easier to process while maintaining proper character timing.

## Micro-Burst Practice
The Micro-Burst practice feature provides 3-5 second bursts of Morse code with immediate feedback. This approach is particularly effective for AuDHD learners, as it helps maintain focus and promotes active recall through short, engaging sessions.

## The Science Behind the AuDHD-Optimized Sequence

The AuDHD-Optimized learning sequence is based on research into how neurodivergent brains learn most effectively:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Many individuals with autism and ADHD excel at pattern recognition. The sequence introduces characters that have clear pattern relationships to each other (like mirror images or extensions of patterns).

2. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: The sequence strategically spaces similar-sounding characters to prevent confusion, and incorporates regular review cycles to reinforce learning before adding new content.

3. **Strategic Spacing**: Research shows that neurodivergent learners benefit from spaced repetition with strategic intervals. The review cycles are placed at optimal points to strengthen neural pathways.

4. **Visual-Spatial Strengths**: The pattern relationships between characters leverage the visual-spatial strengths common in many neurodivergent individuals.

5. **Consistent Structure**: The predictable lesson format provides the consistency that many AuDHD learners need to thrive.

## PIPboy Theme
The PIPboy theme is inspired by the Fallout universe's iconic wrist-mounted computer. It features a retro green-on-black aesthetic with scan lines and CRT effects for an immersive experience.

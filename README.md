# Morse for AuDHD

A Morse code learning application specially designed for individuals with autism and ADHD, using evidence-based learning methods including the Koch method and Farnsworth spacing.

## Features

- **Evidence-based learning methods**: Implements the Koch method with Farnsworth spacing for optimal learning
- **AuDHD-friendly design**: Interface and learning approach tailored for autism and ADHD
- **Multi-sensory learning**: Visual, auditory, and optional haptic feedback
- **Adaptive difficulty**: Progressive learning path with character-by-character introduction
- **Progress tracking**: Track your learning journey with detailed statistics
- **Customizable settings**: Adjust audio, visual, and timing parameters to suit your needs

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/morse-for-audhd.git
cd morse-for-audhd
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Build for production
```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

This app is ready to be deployed on Vercel:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Import the repository in Vercel
3. Deploy with default settings

## Learning Approach

The app uses the Koch method, which introduces characters at full speed one at a time, training your brain to recognize sounds rather than counting dots and dashes. Farnsworth timing extends the spaces between characters, making it easier to process while maintaining proper character timing.

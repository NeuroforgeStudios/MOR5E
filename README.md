# Morse for AuDHD

A Morse code learning application specially designed for individuals with autism and ADHD, using evidence-based learning methods including the Koch method and Farnsworth spacing.

## Features

- **Dual learning paths**: Choose between Logical progression (starting with T, E) or Koch method (starting with K, M)
- **Evidence-based learning methods**: Implements the Koch method with Farnsworth timing for optimal learning
- **AuDHD-friendly design**: Interface and learning approach tailored for autism and ADHD
- **Multi-sensory learning**: Visual, auditory, and optional haptic feedback
- **Micro-Burst practice**: Short bursts of Morse code for improved recognition and focus
- **Adaptive difficulty**: Progressive learning path with character-by-character introduction
- **Progress tracking**: Track your learning journey with detailed statistics
- **Customizable settings**: Adjust audio, visual, and timing parameters to suit your needs
- **Multiple themes**: Choose between Light, Dark, and PIPboy themes

## Learning Approaches

### Koch Method
The Koch method introduces characters at full speed one at a time, training your brain to recognize sounds rather than counting dots and dashes. Characters are introduced in an order that maximizes the distinction between sounds, starting with K, M, U, R, etc.

### Logical Method
The Logical method starts with the simplest characters (T, E) and progressively introduces more complex ones. Characters are grouped in logical pairs (T&E, A&N, I&M, etc.), making it easier for beginners to follow a structured progression.

Both methods use Farnsworth timing, which extends the spaces between characters, making it easier to process while maintaining proper character timing.

## Micro-Burst Practice
The Micro-Burst practice feature provides 3-5 second bursts of Morse code with immediate feedback. This approach is particularly effective for AuDHD learners, as it helps maintain focus and promotes active recall through short, engaging sessions.

## PIPboy Theme
The PIPboy theme is inspired by the Fallout universe's iconic wrist-mounted computer. It features a retro green-on-black aesthetic with scan lines and CRT effects for an immersive experience.
